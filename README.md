Modern JavaScript Curriculum
========

## Objective
Refactor an application to use modern JavaScript from ES5.

## Instructions
There are two branches. The "master" branch and the "solution" branch. The "master" branch will contain the code you're going to refactor. Since there's really no best way to refactor, there aren't going to be any steps for how to approach it. I recommend just going file by file and if you get stuck, check the "solution" branch to see my implementation.

## Step 1:
Fork this repo. Clone your fork. npm install. npm run start. Start refactoring.
